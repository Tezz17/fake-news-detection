<h1>How to Contribute?..</h1>

<p> In order to contribute, just create a branch after that raise a PR. </p>

In the PR mention the following things
1. Heading should be clear and consize
2. The description describes the changes made in short intro, with the issue it closes.
3. That's all. Wait for the PR review

#### HAPPY CONTRIBUTING.
